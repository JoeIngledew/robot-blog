        <h2>Injecting the strange</h2>
<p>So, there's a number of facets I want to build into this adventure. Firstly, I want to make it have a continuous acceleration from the mundane into the weird. I'm a big fan of adventures produced for <em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em> and <em>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</em> which are gonzo and unsettling-weird respectively, and I think I'd like to strike a balance between those different types of strange. In order to achieve this kind of acceleration, I'm thinking of outlining a turn structure - not a particularly strict structure, mind, just a way for GMs to get an idea of when they should dial it up a notch. </p>
<p>If I'm remembering correctly, it's not uncommon for OSR games to have this kind of turn structure for dungeon exploration - a number of squares on a map can safely be explored in 10 minutes in-game-time. This assumes the players are being careful, tapping about with their ten-foot poles to avoid traps and keeping an ear out for wandering monsters. Those games also often call for the GM to roll for wandering monsters each turn (or so, I can't exactly recall). I'm sure it's been done before, but this seems like a good place to inject some mechanics for "upping the ante". For example, the typical "wandering monsters" table that a GM might roll on may have an entry for "Monsters get weirder. All future wandering monster rolls are taken on Table N+1". In that way, I can advance the opposition the longer the characters hang around.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not all about combat encounters. Another way to leverage that random table is to put entries on that will advance the strangeness in other ways. As an example, since this a very lunar-focused adventure, there could be a "The Moon Approaches" entry, advancing the state of the moon and attempting to make a "soft move" (dungeon world terminology) signalling the future of the adventure.</p>
<p>This is all sounding like it could end us being a mess of random tables which would be quite difficult to balance for a consistently good experience, but I'm going to leave that problem to future-me.</p>
<h2>Why is this post titled "Going to the moon"?</h2>
<p>Good question, me! The whole concept of this adventure was born from a weird mash-up of Symphony of the Night (the inverted castle), Bloodborne (The stages of night, The Great Ones) and Majora's Mask (goddamn that moon is creepy). I kind of wanted to see how I could get player characters in a fantasy game to inadvertently go to the moon through a SotN-style inverted castle on a castle and fight/figure out a way to not fight a weird, unknowable cosmic entits. That and I wanted to see if players try to make good use of moon gravity. Obviously, I'll be chucking out conventional physics for the most part since "You are on the moon. You suffocate and your blood boils instantly" would be fucking boring.</p>
<h4>But how do I get players to actually go there without ruining the surprise?</h4>
<p>All of the best adventure modules are fairly open-ended and ideally can just be plonked right into your game world. A favourite of mine, Death Frost Doom, simply requires that mountains exist nearby.  In that vein, I want my adventure to start with a small town. Fantasy worlds are rife with them and they're mostly fairly mundane - as far as the players are concerned, they are locations where they're mostly unlikely to get attacked and where they can restock, have a beer and sleep in a real bed. One of the key features of this town will be a large clock tower (hello majora's mask influence) in the town square. Initially, this will seem like a peaceful, quiet town, perhaps with somewhat skittish townsfolk - we can pass that off as people being understandably nervous about this band of lunatic murderers coming through. Another key feature I want to implement is a place of worship to some kind of Moon God (not very subtle, but hey). This should be a widespread thing amongst the townsfolk, it should be fairly clear that there's at least a bit of a cult operating. I feel like I'm getting too far into detail at this point.</p>
<p>At night, the party will be awoken by some kind of commotion accompanying the clock tower bells. This should drive players to investigate and find out fairly quickly that "The Hunt Is On". If they don't choose to investigate, I guess they'd find out soon enough, since they will be the prey. I've not figured out how to elegantly keep the PCs inside the town for the duration, but I'm currently weighing up the idea of having the exits act as pac-man "exits" - pretty soon it'll loop back into the town, meaning ne escape until they've dealt with the problem. I feel like this is a bit heavy handed and in my experience, the GMs idea of "the problem" and the players' inferred "problem" can be very different, which could lead to a bit of frustration in the players trying to figure out how to escape.</p>
<p>Regardless, The Problem will be "atop the clock tower" - again, not sure how to convey this to the players. Maybe each advancement will bring a hint with the additional danger, so attentive players (read: players who think like I do) are rewarded for picking up on it. Hopefully the combination of being trapped and the hints should lead them to climb the clock tower and thus (bear with me) ascend to the moon.</p>
<p>Next Entry will have a lot more structure than this garbled thought stream I hope. now that I've conveyed an outline, I can start working on specific sections and addressing specific problems.</p>
