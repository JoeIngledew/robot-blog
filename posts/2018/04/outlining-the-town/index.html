        <h2>A Whistlestop Tour</h2>
<p>Today is Day 1 of designing the town. A good name has not yet come to me unfortunately - that'll come in time. In this post I'm going to brainstorm key locations for which I'll write in scenes. I recognise I won't be able to describe every house or establishment in the town, so there may well be an extra table to give results for searching a location that isn't fully described.</p>
<p>The town will be reasonably small - large enough to ensure that the party will never be able to kill everyone overnight but small enough that i don't have to write too much. That means it'll need some repeat establishments, but I suppose that could be fun. For reference, I'll be using a <a href="www222.pair.com/sjohn/blueroom/demog.html">this</a> for demographics and adjusting as required. The population will be in tha ballpark of 2,500.</p>
<p>According to the article I linked, there needs to be a lot of businesses I don't want to write about in order to support the town. We can abstract it a little - while it suggests I should have 15 or so "Shoemakers". We can probably say there's one cobbler successful enough to have a large shop and a number of stalls and smaller shops around that won't need a ten-minute investigation to cover.</p>
<p>The town will therefore have the following "investigation" locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Butcher</li>
<li>A Cobbler</li>
<li>A Barber</li>
<li>A Jeweller</li>
<li>A Tailor</li>
<li>A brewery</li>
<li>An Inn</li>
<li>A blacksmith</li>
<li>A doctor</li>
<li>A bakery</li>
<li>A library</li>
<li>Four houses (ne of which will belong to the mayor)</li>
<li>A shrine/church to The Moon</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives me approximately <strong>32</strong> scenes to write, assuming a low-insight and high-insight variant of each. Phew. Maybe we'll cut some and see how it works.</p>
<p>Other than that, I'll need a way of randomly generating short blurbs on other minor locations for lazy GMs like me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there should apparently be only around 1 guard per 150 residents. That means I may need to revise the encounter table to trim some guards as I will want most of them guarding the walls and two as protection for the cult leader.</p>
<p>There may be a post later tonight attempting to hash out some of these scenes, but I'm not feeling especially creative today so I'll probably leave it there.</p>
