        <h2>Subtlety</h2>
<p>I think I have a bit more of a challenge ahead of me attempting to make this town.</p>
<p>An investigatory-themed adventure is <em>difficult</em>. What makes sense to me may not make sense to any given player of the adventure, and even then, anybody running the adventure may convey certain scenes or dialogues differently. I think I will need to put very explicit cues in place (and many!) that will lead to one another somewhat naturally.</p>
<p>My thinking is a little on-rails currently. I mean, it might not appear as though it's on rails for the players which <em>may</em> be okay but it makes me uneasy as a gamemaster. The "on-rails" approach would be to have a kind of "investigation point" tracking system where at X investigation points, the next piece of evidence <strong>explicitly</strong> points to Y, for example. This would mean the players would visit at least a few locations and get some insight into what is going on. On the other hand, I quite like games to progress more naturally - I'd be pleased if the players were to say "well that observatory sure is ominous, let's just go straight there!" and skipped most of the investigation.</p>
<p>So, perhaps there's a balance to be struck. Maybe it'd work with each place having one subtle clue straight to the endgame and one explicit clue to another location. I'm talking explicit as in it'll be an NPC or a note saying that the target of the investigation "spent a long time in the library one evening" for example. The subtle clue may be something along the lines of symbology of the cult present in the town or constellation diagrams or something. Picking up on and analysing subtle clues would be a way of gaining some insight, as would something out in the open in each investigation location.</p>
<p>Alongside that, time spent in the town will lead the party towards a greater understanding alone. The longer they spend under the influence of The Watcher, the weirder stuff should happen. </p>
<p>The "critical path" will go something like this:</p>
<p>The Inn -&gt; "They visited the market on a daily basis" -&gt; The Market -&gt; "They had a strange stone - I imagine they took it to the jeweller for evaluation" -&gt; The Jeweller -&gt; "I remember they carried a bag of books - heavy tomes. Must have been borrowed from the library" -&gt; The Library -&gt; "They were looking for a particular book, but it had been checked out by the captain of the guard" -&gt; The Barracks -&gt; "They were jailed for attempting to lift a dagger from one of the guards. I released them the next day, but I heard the butcher reported some stolen knives" -&gt; The Butcher -&gt; "They looked terrified for some reason, told me they had to go to the Shrine in the middle of the night. Only [Cult Leader] is there then" -&gt; The Shrine -&gt; Some weird ritual going on, cultists going to the observatory -&gt; The Observatory and dungeon.</p>
<p>It's still fairly long, so I'll see how far I get in writing these scenes out. May need to cut a few and try to make sense of it. To be honesy, I only put The Butcher in because it's easy to make it horrific and I'm rather attached to the hand that'll follow them everywhere.</p>
