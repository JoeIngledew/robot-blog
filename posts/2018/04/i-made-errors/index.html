        <h2>Cutting back</h2>
<p>Ok, I've spent the last couple evenings reading through some adventures from Goodman Games and Lamentations of the Flame Princess and I've realised that the scope this adventure is FAR too large. Most adventures have one dungeon with a maximum of around ten rooms. While I was looking to make more freeform locations, I was looking at a staggering number of locations and expecting players to fight a hell of a lot more than typical adventures would in a much shorter period of time.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to carefully examine what we have and trim the fat (that makes up about 90% of what I have so far).</p>
<p>There's a number of things I think are integral to the adventure - the investigation, the gradual descent into chaos, and the tower. I'm thinking of pulling a little more inspiration from Innsmouth for making the town be gradually more hostile and disconcerting. I think I got the setup almost right, but I'm going to change it up a bit - Instead of it being an escort mission where the person they're escorting is taken away with no way for the party to resist, it can be a rescue mission. The noble may have recieved letters from their child which mysteriously ceased when they were in this town.</p>
<p>In the interest of driving the "town" segment towards non-combat and leaving all the fighting to the "dungeon" segment, the townsfolk won't attack the party during the day. During the night, there will be stange noises, an unusually large moon, etcetera, and there will be roaming bands of cultists.</p>
<p>I also want to keep the insight mechanic in and I want to keep the time pressure there - the Cult Leader will be doing something during the night to beckon the moon, and there will be clues around to point that way. I'm not entirely sure on how the party will gain insight, but it will certainly increase with each night as the influence of The Watcher will increase over the town.</p>
<p>Also, maybe the clock tower should instead be an observatory?</p>
<p>There's a lot to do now and I kind of lost a week letting myself bloat the adventure massively, so I'll be trying to work a little more consistently from now.</p>
