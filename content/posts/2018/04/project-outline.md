Summary: Here's the plan

# The Goal

The goal over the next thirty days is to write a draft standalone adventure for D&D (or your preferred fantasy-ish role-playing game). I have a few ideas to start with but the two most promising ones are a *"Betrayal at the House on the Hill"* style horror thing or a gonzo weird horror thing. Clearly the most exciting is the "gonzo" one but that carries a little more challenge.

## What will I be posting here?

While most of the writing will be outside of this blog, I want to keep this as a progress track and attempt to update it each day with at least one thing. That might be a statblock for  monster or encounter, a harebrained trap idea or just a little bit of the text.

Step one will be formulating a high-level goal or incentive for players to engage with the adventure - I'm thinking probably treasure. Players can't resist treasure. What exactly that will be and how the characters will learn of it is for a future post. I'm too tired from building this blog now (who knew it would be so difficult to build and deploy a blog?!)
