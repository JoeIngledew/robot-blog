## A Whistlestop Tour

Today is Day 1 of designing the town. A good name has not yet come to me unfortunately - that'll come in time. In this post I'm going to brainstorm key locations for which I'll write in scenes. I recognise I won't be able to describe every house or establishment in the town, so there may well be an extra table to give results for searching a location that isn't fully described.

The town will be reasonably small - large enough to ensure that the party will never be able to kill everyone overnight but small enough that i don't have to write too much. That means it'll need some repeat establishments, but I suppose that could be fun. For reference, I'll be using a [this](www222.pair.com/sjohn/blueroom/demog.html) for demographics and adjusting as required. The population will be in tha ballpark of 2,500.

According to the article I linked, there needs to be a lot of businesses I don't want to write about in order to support the town. We can abstract it a little - while it suggests I should have 15 or so "Shoemakers". We can probably say there's one cobbler successful enough to have a large shop and a number of stalls and smaller shops around that won't need a ten-minute investigation to cover.

The town will therefore have the following "investigation" locations:

 * A Butcher
 * A Cobbler
 * A Barber
 * A Jeweller
 * A Tailor
 * A brewery
 * An Inn
 * A blacksmith
 * A doctor
 * A bakery
 * A library
 * Four houses (ne of which will belong to the mayor)
 * A shrine/church to The Moon

That gives me approximately **32** scenes to write, assuming a low-insight and high-insight variant of each. Phew. Maybe we'll cut some and see how it works.

Other than that, I'll need a way of randomly generating short blurbs on other minor locations for lazy GMs like me.

Interestingly, there should apparently be only around 1 guard per 150 residents. That means I may need to revise the encounter table to trim some guards as I will want most of them guarding the walls and two as protection for the cult leader.

There may be a post later tonight attempting to hash out some of these scenes, but I'm not feeling especially creative today so I'll probably leave it there.
