### Grant Us Eyes

Each place the party can explore will have a variety of scenes depending on their insight. It should be unclear which one is "true", and should be able to change

Here's an example:

### A butcher's shop

#### Insight Below X

You enter what seems like a butcher's. There is a counter ahead, spattered with blood, with a variety of knives next to a lone maille glove. above the counter hangs a variety of cured meat. Behind the counter is a desk, kept reasonably clean, with a ledger and a lockbox. 

The lockbox contains a small sum of money (7d6 sp) and a pocketbook (See Below for contents)

There's an archway through to the back where you can indistinctly make out hanging carcasses - a few of them look human from the front. (Gain insight)

In the back, you can see that it's simply pigs hanging on meathooks, in various states of butchery.

The pocketbook contains a few diary entries (Player Handout, TODO)

#### Insight above X

You enter what looks like a butcher's. There is a bloody counter ahead with knives scattered haphazardly around what appears to be a severed hand. On close inspection, it would appear that an eye seems to be growing on the palm of the hand (turned face down to the counter). Curled up behind the counter is the corpse of a burly man, missing a hand, lying in a pool of congealed blood. Above the counter hangs a grizzly display - cured meat is mingled with a variety of body parts, none larger than a forearm (ears, hands, feet, etcetera). Behind the counter is a desk, upon which lies a ledger and a lockbox. The lockbox containd 7d6 silver and a pocketbook (Player Handout, TODO)

Through an archway, you can make out carcasses hanging on meathooks. Some will be pigs, other human, all in various states of butchery. 

If the party stops looking at the hand (and hasn't done anything weird like take it), it will be gone when they look back. Consider putting it elsewhere in other scenes, with the eye facing them.
