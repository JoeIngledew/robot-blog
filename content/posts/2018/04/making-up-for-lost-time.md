## Consistently inconsistent

As it turns out, I'm bad at consistently doing things, especially when I'm exhausted at the weekend. The plan for Week 1 (ending tomorrow!) was to determine an outline including antagonists and goals, which... I have not done. It looks as though I got a little carried away in some details and did not follow my plan particularly well. That means today and tomorrow will be making up for lost time and attemtping to formulate the plan for the antagonist and goal.

## The Opposition

So there's got to be a variety of antagonists. There's a bit less fun in jumping right to the deep end of unknowable eldritch horror, and Call of Cthulhu (the Cthulhu mythos in general) has a useful trope of having actively antagonistic cultists passionately standing in the protagonist's way ahead of an entirely dispassionate horror. With that in mind, I have three tiers of opposition.

Firstly, the Clock Tower Cleric. They will be patrolling with a small congregation in front of the clock tower and should be fairly easy to simply avoid. As with the townsfolk, they will get gradually stronger and more grotesque as the night goes on, but if the party encounters them early they will be a regular human.

### The Lunar Congregation

*For each phase after Dusk, roll a mutation from the **"Townsfolk Mutations"** table for each opponent*

*Cult Leader Coritheus*

 * HD: 3
 * Attacks as a level 3 Cleric
 * Armed with a light mace
 * Armoured with a breastplate under a simple midnight blue tabard with a full moon motif

*Guards Rickard and Adal*

 * HD: 1
 * Attack as level 1 fighters
 * Armed with an arming sword and a spear respectively.
 * Armoured with breatplates and helms

### The Lunar Guardian

Secondly, we have the The Lunar Guardian. This will be the last fight the players need to undertake in order to achieve their goal - It will guard The MacGuffin.

The Guardian is essentially a werewolf, with snow-white fur stained with spattered blood of its previous victims. It will stand in front of the goal macguffin and will not attack unless the PCs attempt to go around it or attack it. 

HD: 4

Attacks: 

 * Bite +3, Claws +2 each
 * Pounce: Save versus Paralysis or be pinned. It takes a bite or a single claw attack each round you are pinned, but automatically bypasses AC for these.
 * Howl: Save versus (Breath Weapon, I think) or be deafened for ten minutes and stunned for a round.
 * Sunder: The Guardian will attempt to rend leather armour or wooden weapons at +3. If it connects, that item is useless. (Perhaps a save is in order)
AC: 12

At half hit points, it will undergo further transformation. Roll Three mutations on the **townsfolk mutation** table. If you get the same twice, the party is lucky and the Guardian doesn't gain another. It will spend the entire round adapting to the new form, allowing the party a few free attacks. In addition, any pinned party members will be freed, but still be prone. It will not make opportunity attacks while mutating.

### The Watcher

And finally, we have the cult's patron, The Watcher. This is going to be a weird one, since it's an eldritch horror and technically powerful as your traditional D&D God, but probably even less interested in fighting a scrapy group of mortals who come knocking on its door. This kind of situation is one I'm going to have to be extremely careful with. Players in OSR adventures should expect a degree of unfairness - there's typically traps that are extremely difficult to avoid that can straight-up wreck the party, but I don't think I've come across an encounter that is nigh unbeatable that you aren't just expected to flee from. 

It's difficult to depict a Lovecraftian "old god" in a satisfactory way. I'm thinking that making use of synthesia might make it a little more uncanny - Muddle up adjectives with different senses, so describing what the smell looks like, what its image sounds like and what its touch sounds like etctera. On top of that, I'd like to leverage a mechanic from Bloodborne here. Bloodborne has a number of things that hinge on the "insight" of the player character. insight is gained through witnessing and interacting with the eltritch and through consuption of "Madman's knowledge" and so on. I can make use of this by littering the first two areas with objects that will grant insight along with a few areas or moments where the player characters will automatically gain insight, such as the phase of night moving on and seeing and dispatching the lesser abomination, the Guardian. A greater understanding of The Watcher makes it somewhat vulnerable, rewarding players who spend a little time searching before they charge in. Insight should also affect saves made due to contact with The Watcher and its Guardian, but I'm unsure if positively or negatively as of yet. Bloodborne has it so higher insight cuases the Hunter to be afflicted with *Frenzy* much faster and if I remember correctly, allows the Hunter to build *beasthood* faster - *Frenzy* hurts a lot, and *beasthood* allows the humnter to deal more damage at the expense of their damage absorbtion. I'll get back to this mechanic, I'm sure.

Without further ado, here is the encounter for The Watcher, split by degrees of insight:

#### Minimum Insight

At this level, the watcher will not be vulnerable in any way - It will simply be a horrifying presence that will continually assault the senses of the party until they flee or are consumed. Each round the party spends in the presence of The Watcher will cause an **affliction** (some will come with insight, which could potentially give The Watcher discernable form).

#### Between X and Y Insight

The party becomes an actual threat to The Watcher at this level, and can hurt it. They can't kill it, but they can dissuade it from continuing to influence the town below by their intent to inflict harm upon it. Each party member will be given a different description, which they can attack. Their attacks will be judged by the degree of violent intent behind them - the more the better - and at a point The Watcher will disengage and leave. Choose a form to present to each party member - it will use the attacks of that form to defend itself. I'm going to leave these to a future post since I've already dpent long enough on this now.

#### Y Insight and above

This is the minimum level where the party can communicate with The Watcher. The Watcher will express some degree of interest and actively try to keep their fragile minds intact. It will present a form that the party find somewhat agreeable in order to communicate. If the party expresses violent intent it will attempt to gently dissuade them before resorting to the tactics of the above level of insight.

The Watcher simply wants to observe what the beings below are capable of and is curious as to what the presence of a different, alient being does to them. It will acquiesce to demands to leave in exchange for asking some probing questions of the party. Think about one of the Star Trek TNG episodes where the Enterprise comes across some formless being that doesn't understand the crew's mortality.

### Closing statement

I'm sure that this stuff is not finalised, it all needs a major revision on balance and I may modify how The Watcher can be interracted with to avoid "feel-bad" moments as much as I can. For now, though, I have the baseline down of how I want to present this thing, which is enough. Tomorrow, I'll tackle the goal of the players.
