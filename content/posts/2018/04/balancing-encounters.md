## Striking a balance

With tomorrow being day 1 of designing the town (which will be immediately followed by designing the dungeon / clock tower) I need to think about what levels I'm targetting with this adventure. I don't think that it's at all survivable for 0-level scrubs and it might be tough for 1st level, so I think I'm going to look at setting a baseline at the 2nd to 5th levels. That's still a fairly wide range, so we'll attemt to narrow it as we go. 

I realise I've assigned some hit dice to the major encounters in a previous post, but those will need to be subject to change following a bit of research into level ranges of other modules. Looks like I've got an evening of reading DCC modules in order.

I need to take into account the quantity and power of the encounters and the potency of the traps I want to include here. On one hand, I don't want the encounters to get stale quickly - boredom could lead to the player characters rushing the end which would avoid a lot of the non-combat scenes and potentially put them in a bad place due to bad design rather than bad player decisions. Equally, if they feel outclassed or are worn down too quickly, then they might cut their losses and simply flee. I'd prefer any competent magic users or clerics to have a few spells left for the last couple of encounters too, which makes things a bit difficult.

A fairly unique challenge I'm facing is actually the timeframe of the adventure. A lot of the time, adventurers will have as many days as they need to raid a dungeon, allowing casters to regain spells and everyone to recover some hit points. This adventure is something that should happen over the course of a single night.

There are a few potential solutions to this

 * **Come back another day**

This is a bit difficult, since it'll have been established that the town is only weird at night, so if the players have the ability to leave and come back the following day, they'd expect the town to have returned to normal. I'm hesitant to have the town be under some sort of magical effect that makes it night until they rescue their charge and I'm hesitant to have the town continue to be weird in the daytime when the moon isn't present. A tangent on this is that the Clock Tower itself exists outside of time and is either not the same clock tower during the day (I'd have to strongly signal this) or actually not there during the day. 

It would give the players the ability to escape and try again when rested, but how long could I feasibly have the noble's child survive?

 * **The Video Game Solution**

This is another I'm hesitant to use. Video games often have ares of respite where the player can replenish health and expended abilities or mana or whatever without using consumables (and typically save or something). I could do something similar with shrines to the moon with some kind of item or feature that the players can choose to either recover expended abilities such as spells or recover damage. It's extremely video-gamey though and I can't think of any way of disguising it beyond a thin veneer of fluff.

 * **Leave it to the dice**

I've talked a bit about an **affliction** table and I **think** I have mentioned that I wouldn't class The Watcher as *evil* per se, just relentlessly dispassionate. So perhaps the affliction table doesn't need to be entirely negative results. Perhaps a character could be healed or nourished by the influence of The Watcher. This isn't too far-fetched, since Clerics exist who see The Watcher as their patron and they would likely have some power granted to them to perform the traditional Cleric miracles.

The issue here is it'll be wildly unpredictable and extremeply difficult to balance.

A potential way of mitigating the randomness is have two tables and roll two results, one for the positive influence and one for the negative - this would leave a limited chance of getting no effect entirely, no positive or no negative (with a 1 on either representing no effect) but also allow for fun weird afflictions coupled with recovery effects. This might be fun in having players intentionally trying to get rolls on the affliction table when they're hurt. It'd also explain the following of the cult - they have the typical godly powers, but with a twist. It's healing, but it's not-quite-right healing that exposes the subject to The Watcher's otherworldly influence. I'm going to take this forward for now and work on the assumption that this is the case. 

The target of this will be constantly applying pressure the the characters without pushing so hard they flee or giving them enough slack that they get bored. I'll likely add to this post once I've done a bit more research? Apologies for the tangent. I guess that's what supplementary entries are going to be like.
