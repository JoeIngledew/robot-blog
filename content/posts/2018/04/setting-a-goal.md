## Engaging the Players

I've thought for a while about how to engage the players in the content and my only idea (as written in my first entry) was awful and railroaded. So, I asked around for a bit of advice and a friend (who is also doing a bit of design for their 30 day project!) came up with something with potential!

Often, the best way to motivate players is to take their **stuff**. When I'm playing a game, I typically get very attached to my things and will go to absurd measures to get them back if they're taken from me. I might go a little further than is usual, but it seems to be a widespread phenomenon to some degree. However, without Deus Ex Machina, having a non-preventable encounter where a thing is stolen is still verging on railroading a little hard, so I've had to expand a little.

I find one of the best ways to get separate something from the party is to give it autonomy. Therefore, the default "MacGuffin" will be a person. The basis of the adventure will be where the characters are an escort for a person, likely of noble birth, from one city to another. I'm going to leave the interpretation fairly open since it'll be a fairly minor character in the grand scheme of things, but I like the idea of them being a snotty teenager or young adult being taken home from university. As a child of a noble, the primary drive for the characters will be money - the parent will be offering a fairly hefty reward for bringing their child safely home.

### Revising the introduction

I'm thinking the most likely place to lose someone isn't when you've retired for the night in a tavern. Most parties will still have someone on watch in town breaks. As such, they will arrive to the town at dusk and will be making their way through the town as the market is winding down. Crowds will still be present, but gradually dispersing in the town centre. Their ward will demand that they have a look around the market for something to buy before they find an inn to retire for the night - they will be sick of trail rations and sleeping in tents.

During this scene, the crowd will separate the party from their ward and during the search, thre townsfolk will all simply stop and stare up at the moon, which will be impossibly low in the sky. This will trigger the exploration side of the game, as the townsfolk will mobilise after a couple of minutes with a Lunar Cleric coming through, ringing a bell and shouting that it's "The night of the hunt". This will turn the attention of the townsfolk, now brandishing weapons (mostly improvised), to the interlopers. 

The clues (which will mostly grant insight) dotted around the town should consistently reference the clock tower, and the activity of the townsfolk should encourage players to take a somewhat winding route there giving them a decent chance of collecting enough insight to stand a chance should they decide to climb the tower further than the Lunar Guardian.

As for making it not a big feel-bad at the end, the party's ward will be safe and have their mind intact. They'll be extremely shaken, but won't have been mistreated. Perhaps I should think of some reasoning as to why The Watcher would intentionally avoid damaging them.

### Optional content

This means much of the adventure is technically optional content, other than the clock tower (the main "dungeon") and part of the town. Trying to funnel players in a more winding path will put them in contact with a lot more and give them more of a chance to engage with the various investigation scenes. As for The Watcher, I don't want to force the players to engage. The Lunar Guardian will be the last hurdle before being able to find the ward (who will perhaps be on the floor above, probably doing something creepy, not cuffed or imprisoned) The ward should then point the players towards The Watcher, talking about how there is something "up there" trying to make contact.

### Conclusion

So that's a fairly broad outline of the adventure. I'm still a little tentative on the motivation of the antagonist, but I think that's more a feature than a bug considering Lovecraftian fiction.

Next week, I'll be moving on to specific town locations and a rough map of the place. I've already reconfigured it a little in my head and moved the Clock Tower from the middle to the northmost edge upon a hill - this is to facilitate the player characters having to navigate a reasonable distance from the market square to the tower and give a continuous point of reference. More on that starting tomorrow!
