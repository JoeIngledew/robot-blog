## Motivation Deficiency

So I haven't updated in a few days since every time I sit down to write, I'm completely stuck. I think I'm lacking in motivation, it's incredibly difficult to get words on a page and not scribble them or delete them after. My ideas are seeming less workable and more forced and I'm less willing to just put something down for revision later. 

I realise this may be due to lethargy from the heat - we've just had a heatwave which has made it difficult for me to manage my regular life outside of work, but if I'm struggling to cook for myself and clean my house it's probably for the best that I put this project on the backburner and try to stabilise a little.

I'll be updating when motivation strikes, but I'm not going to hold myself to daily updates any more since that was just causing anxiety and worsened mental states from having missed a few days.
