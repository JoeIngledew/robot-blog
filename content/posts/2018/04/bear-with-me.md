### I Hate Web Dev

You may have noticed some funniness going on, namely a comment section popping up, disappearing, then reappearing.

This is because I have been messing about with **stuff** which I don't undestand. As a result, I do have a comment section, but it does not work.

Unfortunately, it's not half past midnight and I need to go to work tomorrow, so... I guess it's going to be broken for now.
